A lightweight Chrome Extension that adds a "Copy Clean" button to code blocks on any website, allowing you to copy code without line numbers, formatting, or other unwanted clutter.

---

## üéØ The Problem

Have you ever copied a code snippet from a blog, tutorial, or Stack Overflow, only to paste a mess of line numbers, hidden characters, and weird indentation into your editor?

**Copy Code Cleaner** solves this by intelligently detecting code blocks and giving you a one-click button to copy the pure, raw code to your clipboard.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üìã **One-Click Clean Copy**: Copies code to your clipboard without any unwanted extras.
-   üåê **Works Everywhere**: Detects code blocks on nearly any website (`<pre>`, `<code>`, etc.).
-   üß† **Smart Cleaning**: Removes line numbers, trims whitespace, and decodes HTML entities.
-   üöÄ **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with plain JavaScript (no frameworks) for maximum performance.
-   üîß **Configurable**: Use the popup to enable/disable the extension or to preserve original indentation.
-   üëÄ **Dynamic Detection**: Uses a `MutationObserver` to find code blocks loaded dynamically after the page loads.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the extension in two ways:

### 1. Manual Installation (For Developers)

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Navigate to any webpage containing a code block (e.g., a tutorial, documentation, or Stack Overflow).
2.  **Hover:** Move your mouse over the code block. A **"Copy Clean"** button will appear at the top right.
3.  **Click & Paste:** Click the button. A "Copied!" confirmation will appear. Paste the clean code directly into your editor!

### Extension Popup Settings

Click the extension's icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the settings popup:

-   **Enable Buttons:** Globally turn the "Copy Clean" buttons on or off.
-   **Preserve Indentation:** Choose whether to keep the original indentation or "flatten" the code by removing common leading whitespace.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   **Manifest V3:** The latest standard for Chrome Extensions.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** No frameworks, just modern, vanilla JS.
-   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the popup and button styling.
-   **Chrome APIs:** `storage` and `runtime` for managing settings and state.
